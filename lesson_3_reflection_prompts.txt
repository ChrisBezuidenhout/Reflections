When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating with many or a few people perhaps over long distances or if each person is working on a separate feature ect.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

you may want to only share with other collaborators after you have your part finished and working.
